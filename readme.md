## Description ##

DailyBrief is designed to solve a fundamental problem many new WordPress users find themselves with when they first begin to publish on the steem blockchain using SteemPress; The dreaded SPAM label. Producing too many posts daily on steem hits a cultural bias many anti-abuse teams adhere to "More than 4 posts a day is always SPAM".

DailyBrief compiles a summary of all posts made during a particular day complete with featured images, meta information, and excerpts. It also creates a table of contents, inserts headers and footers with optional macros that auto-fill in article counts, tags and categories used in the processed articles.

> **Important: The plugin is primarily intended to be used alongside [SteemPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/) the WordPress to Steem integration solution. If you want to publish your daily briefs to steem you need to install [SteemPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/steempress/) first.**
> **Note: This plugin requires PHP 5.6 or higher to be activated.**
> **Note: Automated tests for PHP 5.6, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2 are made on each commit.**
